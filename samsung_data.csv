						So I mailed my Note 7 in the special handling box provided (including all original accessories that came with it)  my Gear 360, and Gear VR in all 3 different shipments as instructed. I've tracked it which all 3 packages were delivered back on Oct 11th.   Today is the 24th and the only refund I have seen in my account is for the Gear VR which was little over $100. I'm still waiting for my Note 7 which will be about $950 and for my Gear 360 which will be about $350.  So where is my refund??????? I am STILL waiting SAMSUNG........

I had this problem also and found your post today.  I kept tinkering around and finally cleared out my cloud storage space (at least the gallery (sync) part). I first backed up all my photos to my computer.Opened up gallery and deleted all the photos.While still in gallery, entered into settings and cleared out the photos in trash.Once everything was clear, i synced up again to the cloud (still in gallery settings).Turned off gallery sync after it was done.Afterwards, I checked cloud storage and it cleared out to 0%. I hope this is helps.

Ok ok guys ,i believe i found the problem with this no Bluetooth music. I received my new Note7 yesterday,  so of course i had to  re-pair my phone with radio.  I also ran into same issue.  Music on phone was not playing.  I went to bt settings on phone.  Hit box with 3dots on top right corner.  I saw a play store app come up. At bottom it was asking for permission.  The box was checked off (Always ask) . I checked the box that said (for this app). And BOOM!!!! Bluetooth streaming of my music on phone was working.  I have noticed that this Note7 has a bunch of apps that need some type of permission to work properly.  How this works, for those people having this Bluetooth streaming music issue.

Hey there @user2VRQRVsQ4V
Updates are ultimately pushed out by the carriers. That means we don't always have an exact time frame on when those might be sent out as every carrier has their own time schedule. Often the best option is to reach out directly to your carrier and see if they have any information they can give!

First off - I don't yell, I don't threaten - people should treat each other better than that.  But because I will treat others with respect, I expect respect from the company I am working with - the experience I have had throughout this makes me feel that the company can't even pretend to care. When the second recall came out - I clicked the link and requested a refund.  That was pretty slick and frankly that is what would be cheapest for Samsung and easiest for the customer.  (do more of this)  But I don't have any evidence that you got the request.  (please fix this - send me an email telling me what to expect) After waiting 2 weeks and having no contact from Samsung, I went back to the recall page and called the number on the page that you are directed to use if you purchased from Samsung.com.  I did purchase from Samsung.com, I called the number. I was greated pleasantly and then transferred. The second CSR first said I should go to my carrier....then seemed to realize that he should ask where I purhased the phone I told him Samsung and he said to call 1855-726-8721 but they are gone for the day.  And when I call that number I should not follow the prompts because if I answer that I am calling on the Note 7 recall then I end up back at the 844-365-6197. I tried emailing.  I cannot. Your site will not let me select a product as the list is not populated but won't let me past the screen. Please review your processes and your communications with customers. For example from the page http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/?cid=ppc-  - dated 10/13If you bought your Galaxy Note7 from Samsung.com you should click here to process your refund or exchange. If you have questions, you should contact us at 1-844-365-6197 and we can help you. These words tell me to contact you at 844-365-6197.  Your ivr says if you are calling regarding the Note 7 press 1 - but that isn't what you really need them to do - you need them to call a different number if they ordered from samsung.com and you need to get them to eCommerce.  I love your phone. But these lapses concern me frankly more than a phone that might start on fire. These are process and customer contact experience issues.  These things are what actually tell me if you value your customer. These things actually make me question the whole company and the culture in the company. I expect you to handle the process and communication better. So tomorrow I will try again to contact your eCommerce department. I have yet to have a positive interaction with them.

Hello and welcome to the Samsung Community. We're glad you're here.
 
The Samsung Cloud ( http://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00060509/ ) has several things it can back up, restore, and sync. The full list is there, but it does include the gallery.
The Samsung account back up is a much smaller list. Type of data backed up: Calendar, Contacts, Internet, Memos.
 
By far the most complete version of a back up can be achieved by using Smart Switch. http://www.samsung.com/us/smart-switch/  When downloaded onto your computer you can use the program to back up files from your smart phone, including pictures.

We have now learned why Samsung, Apple, etc seal the units so that you cannot replace the battery. After a few years, they send out a update that drops your battery charge like with the Note 7. Maybe 1st update drops it to 90%, 2nd update to 75%. Soon you upgrade your phone because you think your battery is bad, and you can't  replace it. It could be your carrier. The battery probably wasnt bad at all. They made it look bad by dropping the charge it takes. They can even cut the battery off so you will have to upgrade your phone. Pretty smart idea.

Even when they drop the Note 7 from a 1000 FT, it remained in one piece. Second, why Samsung didn't push back when they discovered that all those cases were FAKE. They are a big company, they should have the balls to push back on all that FAKE propaganda by the media. Third, the RECALL process was a mess, Samsung should contact and coordinate any exchange straight to their customers, it should also have service centers like APPLE does. Four, ANY EXCHANGE should be an equivalent or better device, DOWNGRADE IS NOT AN OPTION. Five, it existing Note 7 want to KEEP their Note 7 because Samsung didn't offer an equal or better device, they should let us keep it and offer a free upgrade when an equivalent of or better device gets available WITHOUT any due Dates or additional cost.Six, Samsung needs to start making their customers happy, not their wireless services providers.

While the devices that actually have had serious problems is low in the grand scheme of things, Samsung didn't want to take any chances. This is not manditory, and is completely up to you if you wish to participate, we just encourage that you do.
 
If there is anything we can clear up there are lots of posts here on the Community about the matter or you can post back here. Between the Community members and any of us from Samsung we have the answers or can get them!

I had bought my Note 7 on ebay during summer in the U.S.A . I was made aware of the recall on my return to my country.  Sadly my country's Samsung store said they are not affiliated with Samsung USA so they can't exchange  or refund. I have called Samsung USA and they told me they can't help from the USA. Also they gave me a number to call.  They said that number could help me because that location is closer to me. (They speak Spanish ,  barely any English) it was pointless because they even refused to let me speak to a supervisor.  Then I called Samsung USA today and they made it clear that they can not help me. I think this is very unfair especially after my loyalty to the brand.  Do you think there is anything I can do?  I can't return it because of the airlines shipping rules as it relates to Note 7. I don't want the phone I just want my money back or exchange.  As of December 19th I will be without a phone. What can I do?

Thank you for that information @mary-jane!
 
That device itself, while purchased in the US, looks to still originate from out of Country. I've got a link to our recall page, where you can get a bit more information specifically on this. It can be found here - Note7 Recall Page
 
There's also a specialized team dedicated to handling the recall of these devices, which I'm not sure as well if you contacted already. But I'm going to go ahead and add their number just in case - 1-844-365-6197
 
Now for a bit of some curveball information coming your way. Since it does appear this device is specific to the Southeast Asia region, I can provide you with the contact number to the support team of those countries. It's a bit of a longshot, but you may be able to get some information specifically pertaining to this device from them. Either way, please let me know how it goes with an update to this post. I'm here to help.
 
The Southeast Asia contact information as as follows:

Hope this helps in any way!

Hi,I have trouble with the Samsung Support in Germany. To make it short: I bought a Note 7 in Germany, go on vacation in the USA. At the time of the recall, there was no chance to give it back bevor the Flight. So, I asked Lufthansa. They told me, there is no problem with the Note 7, I can take it along if I shut it off. At the JFK airport during the check-in at the 15th of October, they told me, I’m not allowed to take the cellphone with me on board (by Law). I was the first customer at the JFK with a Note 7 who was affected by these forbade. No one at the airport could tell me, where I can leave my phone (a day Later there was a solution for these problem, but not when I checked in). So I Send it to friends of mine to CT (to send it with FedEx to Germany -> only via Air-Mail and this is..... ). Now my Phone is in Middletown, CT 06457 USA. No chance to send it by post - no one will take the Note 7 anymore. I am back in Germany and need the Phone here to give it back to the Shop, to get back my money. Samsung support told my, they can do nothing, I should contact Samsung USA. Samsung USA tells me I must contact Samsung Germany and so on and so on.... Mostly I’ve heard ""Oh, this is difficult, we call you back"" nothing ever happens until I called back. Now, is there anybody how can help me?

Don't even want the 5.5 in screen, but have to sacrifice somewhere, right? Don't want to leave Samsung. They gave me very little option. Go with LG V20. Supposed to be equal-ish camera. DEFINITELY not. Since I used my upgrade, I'm stuck with LG phone until paid off in two years. Screwed. I'm so bummed I can't even begin. Phone company will not budge and give grace trade in period.

Well, if you pay off your device then you get all of that back when you return it.   There is nothing to even suggest that the phones will be bricked.  If that were to happen, you return it and get everything you paid for it back.  When you trade in this device for another then you get refunded the ENTIRE amount (that includes tax) and that is applied to the purchase price of your new device.  Tax must be charged on the new device.  The only ""extra charges"" I've seen talked about are the upgrade fees.  The fees paid to upgrade to the Note7 are refunded.  If they haven't been then contact your carrier.  Issues with refunds that haven't been processed yet are probably just that.  Many people posted saying that they were given timeframes of up to 30 days for refund processing.  Samsung was swamped and carriers had no clue what to do during the first weeks of this debacle.  Yes, it really sucked for those people that returned or exchanged their phones during that time.  It sucked more for the people that had to turn in their old devices to upgrade to the Note7.

I have had both experiences....I purchased two Note 7's one from Samsung.com as a preorder, one from Verizon on the day that they were re-released.  Samsung.com - a dozen calls so far - yielding transfers around people not listening and then the calls getting dropped or being told to call back tomorrow, multiple emails to them, filling out the form to request the refund - no consistent message, no box yet, no refund yet, no response to my inquires. Verizon - complete confusion and mis-information. Corporate store where I purchased the phone said I would not get a refund at all and they would not take the phone back and that I was on my own. I called their support line and after 70 minutes, a new phone was on its way and I was told after I returned my Note 7 in the special box they would apply the credit to my bill.  I don't have the box yet, I still have the phone, a credit showed up on my credit card. So so far, I am happier with Verizon but since neither company seems to be able to communicate internally or to their customers, I am pretty unimpressed.

@MoodiQ do not worry about unlocking. Carriers have some legal obligation to unlock your phone. It is not out of the goodness in their heart. That is regardless of whom you purchased it from. Plus there is no distinction between the T-mobile Note 7 phone you buy from Samsung and the T-mobile Note 7 phone you buy from T-Mobile.

My note 7 keeps having an error reading my sim card at certain times. I reset my phone and it fixes the problem, but it always seems to have an error and i wont know until i see my phone and notice that i have zero service. Im thinking its just the sim card having issues but i really dont want it to be a defective note 7. I really like this phone, but having 2 defective note 7s would probably push me onto a different phone company. Also this isnt the first ive had problems with a galaxy. My very first samsung phone was an s5 and it had a ton of issues with the software. From the phone camera not working to frezzing a lot.

Hi I have a question. My phone hasn't gotten hot except when charging on the wireless charger and plugged in. Aka normal routine with any chargers. My phone hasn't exploded or anything at all or gotten very extremely hot like some of the people say. I loved my note 7 device, can I go to the nearest samsung repair center and get a replacement battery to be performed.

No.  There will be no battery repairs performed on the pre-recall phones.  You wouldn't want to do that anyway as your phone will still be identified as a ""bad phone"" by the Samsung IMEI hotlist.Why would you not just swap it for a new one?  If you just had the battery replaced, you would probably be stuck setting it up from scratch anyway.

Hi Samsung, I had purchase a Note 7 on Samsung.com last week and have just receive it.  I know that Samsung has announced in the news to recall ALL Note 7 due to battery issues and offer to make replacements next week for those who want to replace theirs.  Now since I received my Note 7, I'm really want to give it a try and hope it won't over heat or explode.  However, MY VERY CONCERN IS, if I start using the Note 7 that I received and it fried sometimes in the next week or two.  Can I still be able to receive a replacement once Samsung make the announcement eventhough it is damaged?  Anyone can answer this will be very appreciated.  Thank you.

Hey there Skyload, I want to let you know customer safety is our number one concern. At this time there have been no timeframes or limits added to the program. We encourage consumers to take advantage of the U.S. Product Exchange Program for Note7 owners in which Samsung is offering Note7 owners the opportunity to exchange your Note7 for a Galaxy S7, a Galaxy S7edge or a new Note7 (available next week). If any user has the Note 7 device and wishes to look into this program you are welcome to contact our eCommerce team at (800) 726-7864 or you can speak directly with your carriers.

I have the most worst experience regarding returning an item that is ordered online.  I have ordered a Note 7 on Samsung.com in middle of August.  I received the phone a week later and start using it for a few day then stop when the recall was issued on 9/1.  I was thinking of waiting for the new fixed Note 7 to be available and exchange for a new one because I don't want to downgrade to a S7/S7 edge.  However; without another clear information of when exactly the new fixed Note 7 is going to be available, I have decided to call Samsung Customer service to request a return authorization.  The rep I talked to told me that the return label will send to me in 5 - 7 days via email.  I have waited for 3 days without getting the label and call the customer service again to check the status, the rep told me that it will take up to 7 - 10 days.  Ok, I listen to her and wait.  I have waited and waited, and today is the 9th day.  I have send an email out of desperation using the contact me section on Samsung.com last night.  So this morning, a rep (Jasmine) email me back and told me the label will take 7 - 14 days.  SERIOUSLY!!!!!!! Out of my online shopping for the past 15 years, I have never had an experience as worst as this.  Within these few days while waiting, I felt upset at first and then frustrated, worry sick, and getting annoyed.  I was an Apple iPhone user, but by seeing the Note 7 I decided to start getting a Samsung and this is what I get in return?  Samsung make a mistake with Note 7 batteries and the customer is paying the price of losing a thousand dollar phone when it exploded and burns/injuries. Aside of customer return the Note 7 due to recall, if a customer needs to wait 7 - 14 days or probably more (wasting half of a month) just to get the return label (if get the return label) to return a item and get money back, who else will ever buy from Samsung.com again.  Samsung does not have local retail stores, even though there were, Samsung regulation does not allow customer to return item purchased from Samsung.com in the retail store, service center or Samsung hub.

Well, there are a few salient options. The closest to the Note 7 for functionality is probably the Note 5. That's what I traded for and am very happy. Surprisingly, it is as fast or faster than the Note 7. Has pretty much all the functionality, sans the iris scanner and dual light sensor for the autobrightness. What few software features that were unique to Note 7 will probably be ported to the 5, since it is currently Samsungs latest Note phone. The battery is 3000 mAh compared to 3500 mAh. But the 5 uses the Exynos 7420 Octacore SoC, which is quite efficient and so battery life is similar. It comes in 32GB and 64GB models. And of course, you get all the S Pen functionality of a Note. No IP68 waterproofing, though. Just splash resistance. The S7 Edge is more similar to the Note 7 in other ways. It has SD Card expandability. A 5.5"" ""edge"" screen. (The humps on the edges of the screen are more severe than with the Note 7.) No S Pen, of course. The S7 has only a 5.1"" screen, which is a deal-breaker for me. The Google Pixel XL comes out in 8 days, on the 20th. It should certainly be worth a look. It will have Nougat 7.1 and the interesting Google Assistant AI. It's also supposed to have a camera that may be better than even those of the Note 7 and S7(E).  Also interesting, if you are into listening to music through wired headphones, is the LG V20, to be released Oct 28. This phone is a really good phone all around, and has a ""quad DAC"" which is supposed to render superb sound. I think the first ones are supposed to come with Bang and Olfusen headphones or something. Those would be the phones I would have my eye on.

Hello and welcome to the Samsung Community. We're glad you're here.
 
While it appears you cannot do backups of Secure Folder directly thru a Smart Switch, Google or Samsung account; when you try to uninstall the app it gives an option to ""backup and uninstall"". This option transfers all of the files saved or created in the secure folder to a folder on the main system of the phone before removing the app. Alternately you can remove those things in the Secure Folder you want back to the normal folders manually then back them up. Basically the Secure is so secure, it's invisible to the backup system.

This is for any Samsung rep who reads, knows the answer or can get the answer.  With the investigation which has been conducted on the battery issue and knowing there are two suppliers used for the batteries in the Note 7, has there been a determination on which supplier's batteries has the issue and if so then how can we the customers determine if our phone is one of the issue phones?  I ask this because I have not had any issues with my battery yet, however to air on the side of caution I am waiting for my loaner phone to come in.  I am going to stay with the Note 7 because this is the phone I want yet I believe this info will help your customers feel some at ease and help more with the recall if we know what to look for.

As of right now the new devices are being made and fully inspected to make sure they are free of any of the concerns from the originals. We don't have an exact time frame for their release but they will be sent out to carriers to send out to their individual stores as soon as we are sure they are safe. As for the compensation, the only things we can offer are those things already mentioned in the Exchange Program.

I took a look at it and it looks like you have a device that was made for use outside of the US. Please keep in mind that Bixby Voice was only recently made available to US and Korean devices. Your device shouldn't have it just yet, so nothing out of the ordinary here.

If you have the Beta, you may need to clear the cache and delete the data for Bixby Voice and restart the phone. Settings>Apps>Application Manager>All Apps>Bixby Voice>Storage clear cache and delete data. After restart, double tap the Bixby button and see if this resolved the issue. When you deploy Bixby it's a 2 step command. ""Hi Bixby. Open Contact App. Call ""Mom.""

I had issues with my S6 Active refreshing apps while I used it, so went in to trade up to an iPhone. AT&T convinced me to stay with Samsung with a free phone deal for the S8. It ran fine for the first day or 2, but now I'm having the same issues again with both the keyboard crashing down while I type and apps (mainly facebook, google, and snapchat) refreshing while im using them, sometimes seconds after the last refresh. It is so frustrating I'm contemplating begging AT&T to take the S8 back and let me upgrade instead to an iPhone.

Hello there, @user2Eh75sNhwS
Let's try some troubleshooting steps, just let us know how these go!

Are all your Apps are up to date? You have 2 places that you need to look. Google Play store and Galaxy app store. Go to both and check My Apps. Make sure there is no app that needs updating. 
Is your phone OS up to date? Go to Settings, About phone and check for software update. Make sure you have the latest phone software. 
Clear phone cache. Instructions are here. 
Restart your phone in Safe mode. This is just to help you isolate the issue if it is caused by 3rd part apps. Instructions are here.

What I want to do it keep the Default Keyboard as Samsung Keyboard, but use the Google Voice Typing.One Example is I am currently using Apps like the Messenger app and when trying to Voice-to-text, it uses Samsung Voice Input (which is Bixby powered).

I can be in my car, window down on the highway with the radio slightly on and it still picks up my words accurately.I go into Settings > Language and input > On-screen keyboard > Manage Keyboards. From here I disable the Samsung Voice Input. After doing this, it sets the default to Google Voice Typing. This seems to work for a little bit.The problem I have is that after an undisclosed amount of time the Samsung Voice Input feature re-activates itself and reverts back. It's very frustrating.

Hi. I'm starting to use S  Health on my S8 (with a Gear Fit 2) to monitor my workouts.

I gave up trying with Samsung, as their support people really don't seem to know much about their products. I eventually found the answer through experimentation....Automatically detected/recorded workouts show these vague, orange 'workout areas'. To get a map, you have to record the workout manually....go into S Health and start a workout. You will then be shown your route on a proper map once the workout is over.

This is an odd thing for an update to change. Normally that is an option selected when the email account is first set up on the phone. In fact, the only way I know for sure to get rid of that option is to remove your email account then re-add it.

No worries, @Scott16475! I'll be happy to help you out with the cloud.
 
Unfortunately, once you sync your gallery to the cloud, the gallery essentially becomes the could (unless you used up all of the available storage) so you can't delete pictures only from the phone. However, if you have an SD card, you could move the pictures to the card to try and get around this. 
 
You can check to see what pictures are on the cloud from within the gallery app! Just go to Gallery>Settings>Cloud View to check that out. 
 
If you still have trouble with the Cloud, would you mind letting me know what carrier you have? I know Verizon has there own cloud storage, which could change a few things with this.

Let me get some basic information down: 1. My phone has the standard warranty, and complies to all regulations ie latest official software.2. My phone has a crack on the screen that does not render it useless, but is just cosmetically ugly.3. The damage was incurred accidentally whilst in my care.4. I own a Galaxy S8 Plus. With all of this, I would like to wonder if my warranty would cover (or help cover) a screen repair, and if so, how should I contact Samsung to request a repair?  Thanks!

Hello @ChloZ
Technically physical damage of this nature very often voids warranty. Any repair would then have a cost associated with it. However, you can always reach out to Samsung directly via Phone (1-800-SAMSUNG/1-800-726-7864), Twitter, or even Facebook. Naturally you can also reach out to your carrier to see if they have a different option you might like more or maybe someone here in the Community has some other ideas!

A week or two after I got my S8, from Samsung Direct Sales (online), the mic stopped working. Tried multiple fixes, sat on the phone for an hour with a rep, went to Best Buy for a Samsung Experience rep to mess with it; nothing worked. Sent phone back in to Samsung under Samsung Premium Care. Phone was returned, unrepaired, because I didn't send in a Proof of Purchase. I HAD sent in my online receipt, but they gave me the wrong email address. Opened a second repair ticket, they gave me a different email address. Ticket closed again because they gave me the wrong address again for Proof of Purchase submission. Opened a third ticket and verified with online chat the address for Proff of Purchase submission. Sent PoP in and waited a day to check the status. I was told that my online receipt, FROM SAMSUNG, was not a valid Proof of Purchase. Argued with Repair for a while and they had me call Sales. Called Sales and argued with them for 10 minutes because they insisted that the online receipt I had was the only sales document/proof of purchase they produced. Repair department will not accept my phone without a proof of purchase that includes the IMEI and customer name. The receipt Samsung sends does not have an IMEI number on it, and apparently such a document does not exist in their systems. Repair told me to try sending an activation receipt from my provider. That would be great if i was getting first time service with my new phone or had bought it from them and was on a payment plan. As it is, ATT does not associate your IMEI with your service on your bill unless you purchase through them or are paying the phone off with them on an installment plan (I spent another 30 minutes on the phone with my provider to see if they had any documents that might meet the requirements; they did not). I would highly recommend against purchasing from Samsung Direct Sales, and if this is the hassle one can expect from Premium Care, I would recommend that you do not waste your money on that service either. They require ridiculous amount of documentation to process a repair, and depending on how you purchased your phone, said documentation may not exist that meets their criteria. It has been about two months since I purhased my phone, and as far as I can tell, the third repair ticket was closed as well because I haven't received any shipping labels, again. I find it absolutely ridiculous that Samsung will not repair a phone, that I bought from Samsung, because I don't have paperwork their own sales department does not provide, or that the receipt they did provide me is not sufficient to prove that I legally obtained the phone.

Update**  After many phone calls and opening a total of five repair tickets, the repair department finally accepted the documents I had sent them as a proof of purchase and are repairing my phone, ONLY after one of the moderators from this forum got involved and was communicating with repair on my behalf. I think it has been about a month and a half since my phone stopped working correctly and I initiated the repair process. All I can say is good luck to anyone else who has a defective product purchased directly from Samsung...

Hey guys! You can easily change lock screen notifications settings on Samsung galaxy S8 devices. In galaxy S8 and galaxy S8 plus device, you can see two options for set lock screen notifications, one is hide content and another is notifications icons only. These settings can be found withing Settings > Lock Screen & Security > Notifications. You can also customize what apps you actually receive notifications from and which ones will show content or just the icon when your screen is locked:

From the date of your confirmation email, it should take 6-8 weeks for approved claims to have their gifts delivered. Once the tracking information is available on it, the promotional department should send you an email with it and you will also be able to see it on the status page. Bundles work a bit differently though since you had to actually go in and click the link to purchase it. I would recommend contacting our E-Commerce department since they handle online orders.

Literally have called customer service 4 times already trying to return the **bleep** phone. First guy said it would up to 5 days for an RMA and email with return label. 2nd call on the 5th day said keep waiting. 3rd call the rep apparently upgraded the situation, said wait 1-2 days.  4th call, they said it's weekend, Ecommerce is off and there's nothing she could do. Called on May 2nd, today is the 16th and still nothing! No followup call or email whatsoever. How embarassing. There's no option to return online when most companies out there let you use an automated RMA system. This is the last time I'm buying a Samsung product. I had originally want to exchange because of tint issue, erratic Bixby button, and poor seal on the phone. Now I'm just going to return the **bleep** thing. The phone and the extra pack were over $1000! This is unacceptable for a multi billion dollar company, way to win back your customers.

I've been dealing with the same thing... I wanted to exchange my S8+ for a regular S8's and I called their e-commerce dept. The rep said he didn't know if that could be done but had to ask his supervisor who had already left for the day (which was ridiculous and unprofessional in itself) so I had to call the following day. The next day I was told I had to return the phones and re-purchase them... the whole process seemed inconvenient and ridiculous but I agreed and I was told I would get a return label 3-5 business days later. A week later, still no labels and I had to call once again... this time the rep stated my request for return labels was denied and I'm stuck with two phones that I don't even want. My mind is blown how terrible their service is, and any other reputable company would honor a simple request to exchange. Keep in mind I had the phones for about 2 weeks. I will never make the same mistake and order any product from this shady company again.

Good question, @userj3SGYmtDnv.
Due to the way the Knox secure folder is made, you are unable to backup the data in this folder in order to ensure the utmost security for your data. However, all the other data on your device can be backed up using Smart Switch.
However, when you go into secure folder to uninstall it, it should give you an option to backup and uninstall; which basically moves everything from secure folder back to personal space on the internal SD card. You should then be able to migrate that information to the new phone and from there set up Secure Folder again.

It sounds like the earbuds themselves are just not working, but the controls on them still are. This very well could be hardware related. By chance if you plugged those AKG earbuds into another device to see if you get any sound from them at all?

What I want to do it keep the Default Keyboard as Samsung Keyboard, but use the Google Voice Typing.One Example is I am currently using Apps like the Messenger app and when trying to Voice-to-text, it uses Samsung Voice Input (which is Bixby powered). This voice input app is very clunky. It doesn't input correctly and is slow.Google Voice Typing is FAR faster and FAR more accurate. I can be in my car, window down on the highway with the radio slightly on and it still picks up my words accurately.I go into Settings > Language and input > On-screen keyboard > Manage Keyboards. From here I disable the Samsung Voice Input. After doing this, it sets the default to Google Voice Typing. This seems to work for a little bit.The problem I have is that after an undisclosed amount of time the Samsung Voice Input feature re-activates itself and reverts back. It's very frustrating. I never had this problem on my S6 or S7 Edge.Is there any way to permanently disable the Samsung Voice Input?

@userZt65LVh3xE you can't have Face and Iris recognition on at the same time, so you will have to have a pin, pattern, or alphanumeric password as a back up. I myself use fingerprints and a pin. If you don't want to keep unlocking the screen at places you often are (work, home, etc) you can set up Smart Lock to auto unlock when at a certain location, or connected to Trusted Bluetooth devices. Smart lock is in that same Lock Screen & Security menu.

Hello, I bought two S8+'s directly from samsung.com as part of the BOGO deal they had. Now I am having trouble activating the phone to get the rebate. On my account, it tells me to click the ""Activate phone"" button, but that button doesn't exist. When I contacted Samsung support before I bought the phones, they said I will be able to activate the phone on the ""Thank you"" page. I didn't even get a Thank You page. It seems that many, many, MANY people are having this problem, so my questions are: Has anyone been able to activate their phone and get the rebate? If so, how? If not, can someone from Samsung help me with this, here in this forum? I am sure you will be helping many others at the same time. I have gotten the run around multiple times. I went from tech support chat -> tech support phone -> e-commerce -> promotions -> e-commerce again (e-commerce department closed for the day by the time I got there again). I will try again tomorrow, but I am seriously considering returning the phones. It's not worth all this hassle and there's probably a time limit from when we get the phone to when the rebate offer expires. Some additional information; I am on a family plan and have no intention of opening a new line. I contacted Samsung before I bought the phones and they informed me that I do not have to open a new line to get the deal. Twice. I talked to two different reps to make sure. Thanks in advance.

Yep. My previous post: I called Activations today (866-265-4505) and explained to them the situation. They acknowledged that the ""Invalid credentials"" is a common error and then told me to:1) Call T-mobile and have them activate the new SIM card2) Call Samsung back (e-commerce, 855-726-8721) and tell them T-mobile activated my phone3) E-commerce will then note on my account that T-mobile activated my phone and I will get the rebateAll of that went without a hitch and they gave me a ticket # that I can use to check up on, and that I will get my rebate in 7-10 days. You might want to start with Activations as well to confirm this, since it seems like people are getting conflicting or different answers. My rebate came a few days later. I got two emails about the Netflix offer, each with a link for 6 months free. Gmail combined both emails into one thread (they came almost simultaneously) so be sure to check it thoroughly. A big hassle and headache, but keep at it! Good luck!

Still looks just fine. Like the phone says, while the screen has used a lot of power, it was also on for over 5 hours during that 20 hour period of time, which would certainly add to how much battery it would be using. Otherwise though, your battery usage looks great!

I long press on home screen and the only option is the 'wallpapers and themes' which is the samsung wallpaper store thing. When i click on 'My wallpapers' 'view all' up above it only shows me the infinity wallpapers, the default and any i downloaded from the samsung theme store ONLY.

Besides the restart issue I've been having over a month.  My Original charger that came with the phone only charges in Slow mode and if I use it while charging the percentage goes down.  I had no other choice but to use another ch larger with the adapter that came in the box.  When I did that it says fast charge but it seems it charges at a basic speed.  Last night I decided to try the original cord again because I don't like using the adapter.  I turned off phone with 14% battery at 11pm I woke up this morning around 7 i turned my phone on and the battery was at 67%.  
What am I suppose to Do? Everyone is telling me to make I am use the original charging cordand or it can cause some issues with my phone.  Well it already has enough issues!!!  It cost $40 to get a new samsung usb-C cord.  I just Spent/will spend a crap load money on it. My carrier said they will give me a discount on a cord for $30 but it's not a Samsung and  I don't think I should have to pay for another cord!!  So what Do you suggest I do?

Whoa there. So you're using the original cable and adapter, all the OEM fixins? Sounds like you'd want to go ahead and call in to get an exchange on that then. Especially if you've already successfully used a different charger. I'd say go ahead and give our support team a call at 1-800-726-7864 to get that set up.

@usernqI7mjkj68 yeah, because Bixby doesn't do that. Unless you have smart lock of some type enable, etc. That's why there is an option in Bixby to provide a voice password too.

Hello, somebody tell me please what the heck... I just checked wikipedia and SMS are being sent since 1992! I would think that our super duper today's smart phones would have mastered this ancient technology already. What bothers me is that whenever I write sms to more then one recipient and it exceeds 31characters it is sent as MMS! Samsung messages app does not even warn me that this will happen! The result is it may cost much more money and there is a big chance recipients will never read it because they don't have MMS setup or they even have those old dumb phones!I tried doing the same in Textra and indeed it happens there too even when I have all MMS options in both apps disabled. Textra shows when the message changes to MMS before sending at least unlike Samsung messages. I have a feeling this might not be a problem of just Samsung phones but maybe Android Nougat, is that right? But I really don't understand it from a technical point of view. Obviously I can send a long multihundred characters message even with national characters (czech) to many people one by one and it's sms, so why the heck can't the phone save me time and do it for me when I am organizing some session with friends and sorry, they don't all have Whatsapp or messenger or data turned on all the time

How do you change the S8 so that the Download folder defaults from internal memory to the SD card?  It is well documented on the Internet how to do this before the S8 using Samsung's My Files app settings.  Looking at this same thing on the S8 Android 7.0 shows that some of these settings have changed and no longer can you do the same thing.  See www.tomsguide.com FAQ page for this.

Safe Mode will appear in the lower left corner of the screen. 4.Test to see if the issue is still occurring while in safe mode. If it is not there is an issue with the application/s while in safe mode the app developer/s would need to be contacted. Note: To exit safe mode reboot the phone. Step 2. Please try to install the Smart switch application on your PC and connect your phone using USB cable. Please access the link below to Know more about the Smart Switch. Link:http://www.samsung.com/us/smart-switch/ To download the Smart switch on your Computer, please follow the below link. Link: https://d2ogrndh9skxtm.cloudfront.net/32/SmartSwitchPC_4.1.17023_6.exe To download the Smart switch on your MAC, please follow the below link. Link: http://www.samsung.com/us/assets/SmartSwitch_for_Mac.dmgOnce you install the software on your PC, please follow the below instructions to update the phone. Note: This option will work if the available update is compatible through Smart switch. 1.

If the update is compatible then a notification to update the phone will be displayed right on the Smart switch screen. 4. Select the update option to update the phone. Step 3. If the issue persists after performing the above steps, in this situation we request you to perform the Factory reset on the phone and then check for the updates. Please backup the data before performing the Factory reset as performing them before would erase the entire data.

Hello Community, 
 
I just thought I would throw this in a message board to see if I could get some assitance. I am in love with my S8+. I am also in love with internationally unlocked phones, hence I cannot use Samsung pay. I was wondering if changing the CSC code would then allow me to use Samsung Pay. If not what else can I do.
 
So it may be clear my phone model is sm-g955f

Hello @usereRQwE3nf7d
Thanks for your post! Changing the CSC code wouldn't actually change much in this case. The phone model number, hardware, and even software would all prevent Samsung Pay from working. Even with US devices, if it is carrier unlocked it removes Samsung Pay from functioning on them so I don't think changing the code would help much here.

I asked Bixby to find food near me and it brought up my camera and showed me a 360° viewer of what restaurants were around me. It was so cool!! But now I can't figure out how to do it again!

I just switched to Samsung from LG, and I wanted to know if there is a way to change the vibration type of notifications on my s8+? I understand there is a vibration profile select for the ringtone, but I have searched all over for an option to customize my notifications so that when my volume is down and in ""vibrate mode"" I can tell the difference between a text, an email, or Facebook notification. On my LG G5 I was able to select a single short vibration for a text, a double short vibration for Facebook/miscellaneous notifications, and a single long vibration for an Email. Right now on my s8+ all notifications are a quick double vibration. Any free third party apps that aren't too bulky to accomplish this? Thanks!

Once apps are open go to 3 dots upper right corner and tap on it. Got to Show system apps and tap on it. Scroll down to Edge Screen and tap on that. Once it opens long hold Storage till it opens.

So happy to get the Galaxy S8+. Amazing phone...just one annoying thing. The notification system does not work as intended. Some app wakes the screen and most don't...like txt msg and whatsapp works. You have to actually go into whatsapp to turn on the app setting notification in order to get it to work. But no other notification wakes the screen.  I have tried multiple settings...like turn off edge lighting, turn on and off notification settings in the notification section and also at the lock screen and security section. No settings wakes the screen when notification comes in. It only beeps and LED light turns on.  I have also reset my phone 3 times (total wipe) and did not recover apps and have contacted tech support 3 times and the last time I had to go to a Samsung kiosk at Best Buy to reflash with new firmware. Still does not work.  I am not sure if this is the limitation of touchwiz, but it is dissapointing with such an open OS, you cannot execute such a simple thing.  Please help if someone could figure this out...or maybe Samsung just needs to get this fix asap.  Jay

I did do my research and read that Samsung promises updates for the unlocked S8 would be timely unlike in the past. So far, that seems to be holding up.

Ok.  Since posting my original problem I figured out something.  When I purchased my s8 all apps and settings got switched over using the smart switch app.  This obviously caused glitches and even was getting ADS on my home screen.  I backed up my phone did a factory reset.  Only installed exactly what I'm using.  Now video calling feature works across the board.  Doesn't need to be on WiFi.  So if you're having same problem this could be why.  Also don't install battery savers.  Usually loaded with malware and ads that cannot be detected with usual virus and malware apps.

 @userkGFyLSY1y1, Please try these steps below: Step 1: Do the forced reboot / soft reset procedureThis must be the first thing you should do; it’s easy and safe. This will rule out the possibility that the phone’s firmware crashed or the problem was caused by any minor system-related issues. It’s equivalent to the battery pull procedure that we often did to phones with a removable battery. The Galaxy S8 doesn’t have a user-removable battery so Samsung devices a combo to do the simulated battery disconnect.To do this, press and hold both the Volume Down and Power keys together for 7 to 10 seconds. Assuming the problem was indeed just a minor firmware issue, the device should start up normally. Of course, continue your observation until you’re satisfied the phone is working perfectly because if you encounter hiccups even after the phone turned on, do not hesitate to have the phone replaced. You don’t want to deal with any sort of problems with a brand new, premium smartphone.Step 2: Charge the phone to know if it responds when plugged inNow, let’s rule out the possibility that the battery hasn’t been charged a bit before packing by charging the phone. Use the original charger that came with the main unit. Leave the phone plugged in for at least five minutes and then check if the charging icon shows on the screen and that the LED indicator at the top of the display lights up. If both charging signs show, then attempt to turn the phone on after a few minutes of charging. It should turn on normally.However, if none of those signs show, it means the phone isn’t charging. At this point, don’t do anything anymore, except bring the phone back to the store and have it replaced. A brand new (and very expensive) phone should turn on and charge out of the box. If it doesn’t, it’s defective.In the event that the phone shows those charging signs and you can actually see the battery indicator going up in percentage and the phone still refuses to turn on, you may proceed with the next steps.Step 3: Attempt to boot your Samsung Galaxy S8 in Safe modeAll we have to do is bring the phone to life so you can use it and while we don’t know for sure what’s preventing it from turning, we need to try to do things that may help it boot up. So, in this step, try to see if it can boot up in safe mode by following these steps:Turn the device off.Press and hold the Power key past the model name screen.When “SAMSUNG” appears on the screen, release the Power key.Immediately after releasing the Power key, press and hold the Volume down key.Continue to hold the Volume down key until the device finishes restarting.Safe mode will display in the bottom left corner of the screen.Release the Volume down key when you see Safe Mode.Uninstall apps that are causing a problem.If the phone still won’t boot up in this mode, then move on to the next step.Step 4: Try to boot your phone into Recovery modeIt is useless to wipe the cache partition or reset a brand new phone but what we want you to do is to try to see if the phone can power up its hardware and successfully boot in one of the modes. If successful, then we know that the phone’s hardware is fine. However, if it also won’t boot in recovery mode, then it’s safe to assume you’ve got a lemon and you need to send it back and have it replaced. But this is how you boot your phone in recovery mode:Turn off the device.Press and hold the Volume Up key and the Home key then presses and hold the Power key.When the Android logo displays, release all keys (‘Installing system update’ will show for about 30 – 60 seconds before showing the Android system recovery menu options).After this please check out my repair/replace options:  There are several options such as:1.

",2,Valued Contributor (Elite),"['\n\xa0@userkGFyLSY1y1,\xa0Please try these steps below:\xa0Step 1: Do the forced reboot / soft reset procedureThis must be the first thing you should do; it’s easy and safe. This will rule out the possibility that the phone’s firmware crashed or the problem was caused by any minor system-related issues. It’s equivalent to the battery pull procedure that we often did to phones with a removable battery. The Galaxy S8 doesn’t have a user-removable battery so Samsung devices a combo to do the simulated battery disconnect.To do this, press and hold both the Volume Down and Power keys together for 7 to 10 seconds.

As a slightly random question, what Voice Mail system (if any) do you use? Some, like Google Voice, keep deleted Voice Mails on the phone which has been known to cause problems.

It's not your phone that's causing the problem!  Sadly, there is no solution, except to keep complaining and hoping they change their policy.  I switched from Sprint back in early March and was happy for about a month or so with true unlimited speeds of about 15-20 Mbps.  I even traded in my Sprint S7 Edge that was unlocked and paid for becuase they could only get 3G to work and not 4G due to it not having the same frequencies as the US Cellular version of the same phone.  Oddly, the 3G speeds were about double what I currently have on ""high speed"" 4G.  A couple of weeks of having ""slow"" 3G speeds, I decided to get a US Cellular S7 Edge, when they had a $250 trade-in promo going on.  I had trouble getting my $150 gift card but that's another story.  Plus, my employee discount doesn't work with US Cellular unlimited plans because it's already such a ""great deal"".  LOL.   In hindsight, I should've just kept my Sprint S7 Edge running on the US Cellular network, since the phone was paid and worked just fine on faster 3G speeds.  Now, I'm paying for a new phone that has half the internet speed! For some reason, they started capping unlimited speeds at 1.5 Mbps back in late April for ALL unlimited plans.  At first, i went in to the store and they swapped sim cards and even went as far as warrantying me a new phone, since the Customer Service Reps at the store had no clue why my speeds suddenly were only 10% of what I used to have.  Still got the same crappy speeds with the new phone.  I showed them my speeds on a speedtest app and the needle briefly goes past 10 Mbps and quickly slows down to 1.5 Mbps EVERY time, which is very slow for 4G/LTE speeds, in my opinion.  I added 3 lines to my account and they have the same slow speeds.  When my friends phones on my plan also had the same exact speeds, I went back to the store for a solution.  After them not knowing the reason why, they eventually called tech support and they found out that they are capping all unlimited plan speeds at 1.5 Mbps!  Their reasoning is that is acceptable for SD streaming.  Okay, I get that, they even have that in their fine print but what about other uses for data besides streaming?  They need to add to the fine print that ALL internet speeds will be slowed to 1.5 Mbps on the unlimited plans, NOT just streaming.  I can only imagine how slow the network gets on 2G when you reach your 22GB data limit, if that's even possible at 1.5 Mbps!  I'm regretting switching to US Cellular and should've went to Verizon!  I hope people keep complaining and they change this stupid policy or at the very least, add it to their fine print so people know why their speeds are slower than they should be.  In the long run, they will lose many customers to other carriers that do not slow down unlimited speeds until you reach your 22 GB cap and even then, some don't unless the network is congested!  They tried to get me to switch to a shared plan to avoid the ""unlimited"" speed cap but you get charged $15 per GB if you go over and I think that's what they want.

In order to get early access to Bixby voice, you had to sign up on Samsung's early access page. As of now, the sign-up is closed and they are not taking any more registrants.

Hello all, seeking answers for my wife and her phone issue. (NOTE: will update after *#0*# speaker test)  My wife has had the S8 for maybe two months now, and it's developed a unique audio bug, one that is prevalent through all streaming applications and usage. (there are a few things I haven't tested yet, like with or without headphones, or over Bluetooth, so bear with me for now)  She  is experiencing a pulsating effect to the audio, like a slow helicopter chop, or oscillation during all kinds of media playback, YouTube, Spotify, etc and even at certain points, like when someone is speaking in the video, their words are punctuated with electronic chirps. Had anyone else had this issue? I've seen plenty of posts about the S8 audio cutting out during a shake, or when pressure is applied to the phone body, but she has neither of those issues.  She listens to sleep meditation videos at night and this waffle, or pulsating/chirping, oscillation, or whatever it is,  is unbearable.  I've disabled usb audio routing in developer options, but she's asleep and I won't be able to run a *#0*# test until the morning. Fixes in the meantime will be much appreciated.  Thank you.

UPDATE!!  the problem resurfaced. However the root cause has now been determined. (why, though, still remains a mystery.)  It seems to be an app conflict. The issue only arises when active sleep tracking is engaged with the Sleep as Android app. Something with a particular sensor, more than likely the accelerometer that tracks motion during sleep, is in conflict with with the audio on the S8. It's causing the chirping. When I pause sleep tracking the audio goes back to normal.  I've altered the app developers of this issue.  When my wife tracks her sleep she listens to meditation, so it's an audio thing there.  I hope this helps anyone with a similar problem.  Cheers

Thanks for the screenshot. Since the battery is lasting over 21 hours, I'd say it's just fine. Now, Google is using a lot of the battery, but if you're actually using it a lot, then that would make sense. If you hardly ever use that app, or even never do, that would be a concern worth reaching out to Google directly about.

I'm used to turning off my screen manually, or at least having it wait for me 5 min before is goes to sleep. On this phone I have it at 15 min but it still sleeps in 6 seconds. I even tried downloading a third party app that is supposed  to disable the screen from sleeping unless I do it manually or turn off the app, but it still sleeps on me in 6 secs. I don't have any power saving features on, nor do I have smart stay on. Please help.

Hello. I had this same problem , guessing you just got it? I even got a replacement phone and still happened. The problem is some where in when you restore phone from one of your accounts, like Google account or Facebook . What I had to do was a clean wipe, DO NOT restore your phone from a back up, just do a clean boot, then link your accounts and just go to your Google account and grab you contacts and do apps Manually . This should fix your problem.. or at least did for me

Will Samsung be offering any sort of compensation or free promo to us S8 and S8+ owners who still don't have Bixby Voice yet? This is getting insanely ridiculous... It would be different if you could remap the Bixby button, you fine people at Samsung have purposefully prevented that unless we root our phones. Totally uncool.We deserve answers here...

Sorry for the confusion, I only restated my original answer I gave you to let you know I understand and to restate what you were asking for. Again, unfortunately I have no information on that becoming a possibility. It would be only speculation on my part to affirm that it would become possible. I wish I had something different to convey but at this time there is no way to remap the Bixby button and no indication that it will become possible in the future.

If your device functions normally while in Safe Mode, you may want to go ahead and start deleting your third party apps (You can always redownload a new copy from the Galaxy App or Google Play stores). A best practice would be to either start with the most recently downloaded and work your way backwards, or to uninstall all of them and redownload one by one. Hope this helps.

It appears that the app was calculating the backup size on both the internal storage and the sd card storage and was trying to include over 30 GB of music.

Hi,  i have Samsung S8, running Android 7.0. I have gotten into the habit of frequently wiping the cache partition to avoid problems.  Normally, after I give the Samsung salute (Vol up, Bixby key & Power), then release after about 20 seconds of a blue screen (same color as Windows ""death screen""), I get an android on its side with a yellow warning triangle saying something like illegal command or some such; I then tap power button and I get the Android OS selection screen (looks like MS DOS screen).  Finally I select Wipe Partition and reboot. Well, last night, I did that (or at least I thought I did), but rather than reboot, I got kind of a blue-green screen with a down arrow saying downloading do not shut off target device.  Well after a while of doing this and nothing happening, I pressed the power button and all seems to be OK. Can anyone explain what that was, how it happened and what it means? Thank you very much

Sorry for the late reply, @Rsnic. Odin Mode, or Download Mode, is a state that allows you to flash firmware through Odin or other desktop software. 
 
However, I do not recommend using this mode since installing or flashing any unauthorized software is considered ""rooting"" your device and will void your warranty. 
 
It sounds like nothing was downloaded, so no harm done. If you have any other questions, please let either the Community or I know. Cheers

Samsung S8, Always on Display screen disabled. My phone screen is black when it's sitting on my desk.  When I get a text message the phone plays the notification sound once, and after a few seconds the little blue light in the upper left corner flashes.  That's all. If I'm in another room when the message comes in, unless I notice the little tiny blinking blue light, I have no idea I missed a text.  Sometimes it's quite a while before I notice the light (or go to use my phone). On my iPhone 6S, when my phone was just laying there and a text message came in, I got a content bar on the screen, it ""woke"" my phone up, and I could set it to keep making a noise every few minutes until I acknowledged the message.  There were options they called banners or something like that.  With the iPhone set up it wasn't possible not to notice a missed text.  With my Samsung, it's easy to miss them. How can I have a better notification so I'm not responding to missed texts 30-60 minutes later?? PS - When I click the unlock button on the side, on the next screen I do see the content bar/banner that displays the text message.  If I use the home button to unlock my phone (by long pressing it) I skip this screen but at least I see the little 1 badge over the Messages icon.

Try authenticating with att.net servers during set up of the account instead of BellSouth.net Like this: Just pick if you want POP or IMAP and choose settings accordingly. Should do the trick.Keep reading if you need/want detailed instructions and why youre having to do this. Your BellSouth.net email now ""goes through"" AT&T servers (the servers that are now owned by AT&T after aquistion).-For Account username; use full BellSouth.net email address, and of course password i.e. youremail@bellsouth.net -The ""Yes"" in the above chart means put each security type as SSL (incoming and outgoing).-Check that the numbers match for outgoing and incoming after selecting SSL for both: 993=incoming/IMAP465=outbound/SMTP-Also make sure you toggle ""authentication required before sending"" to on position and, again, put in your full BellSouth.net email address as username/password.-Below is how your server settings should look if going with IMAP, for example: -If you don't know how to get to the above settings and are starting from very beginning:Tap Samsung Email App>Menu (Three dots or bars upper left)>Tap Settings Gear>Tap Add Account>Enter Your bellsouth.net email and password>Tap Manual Set Up. -If editing an already set up account that is not working:Tap Samsung Email App>Menu>Tap Settings Gear>Tap the account you wish to edit>Scroll to bottom and Tap ""Server Settings"" Good luck!

",Constellation,,,"
Here's the low down on Do Not Disturb for the S8 & S8+ from what I can see:
This setting allows you to block all notifications and alerts. The options below determine what notifications can make sounds, and during what time periods you want to enter this mode:

From home, swipe up to access Apps.
Tap Settings > Sounds and vibration > Do not disturb.
Tap On/Off to enable the feature.

Scheduling:
This option allows you to turn Do not disturb mode on or off automatically at scheduled times.
Note: Scheduling is not available if Do not disturb mode has been turned on manually.

From home, swipe up to access Apps.
Tap Settings > Sounds and vibration > Do not disturb.
Tap Turn on as scheduled, and set the Days, Start time, and End time.

Allow Exceptions:
This option lets you customize which notifications are allowed while your device is in Do not disturb mode.

From home, swipe up to access Apps.
Tap Settings > Sounds and vibration > Do not disturb.
Tap Allow exceptions, and then tap one of the following options:


No exceptions: Allow no exceptions.
Alarms only: Allow exceptions for alarms.
Custom: Set your own exceptions.

I've seen some people use Automatic Rules in their DND settings, but a lot of other Galaxy Models don't include it as well. So it might be carrier specific or something that started after Marshmallow. Again, based on what I'm seeing here in my research.

Thank you for your response, but I found out that the problem is solved much more simply. When I bought my phoneI I used Smart Switch to transfer my apps.  After doing so, I wanted to keep some of those apps in the Secure Folder so added them there.  This resulted in some apps appearing in the Secure Folder--their app icons had a lock in the lower right corner.  However there was still a copy of the app in the regular app folder. When this happens, the S8 acts as if these are different apps and when a message comes in on the app, it's posted twice--once from each app.  And it can also have two windows of the app open at the same time. THE SOLUTION is to go into the main app folder (not the Secure Folder) and uninstall the app.  You will be left with only one copy of the app in the Secure Folder.

Bixby Voice is awesome and I'm loving it however it is having trouble with voice recognition of some words.

@Aeradore Yes, everytime you say something there is a button that lets you give feedback on how Bixby did with the command.  Bixby does have some difficulty with the English language, as that was the main reason it was delayed. Just keep using Bixby and that will make her better!

Can someome help?

@userzfhM8mTiQQ Workaround:Try restarting your phone. Hold down the Power button and select Restart. The issue should be gone, but it may return.Potential solutions:Try turning your S8 off and removing your MicroSD card. Does your S8 wake faster without it? Many people have found that the MicroSD card they’re using seems to be impacting the wake time. It’s not clear why this is the case, but it may be because the card isn’t genuine. You can use an app called SD Insight to check whether your MicroSD card is legitimate.It may be worth backing up the contents of the MicroSD card on your computer and wiping it, then trying it in your S8 again.Some people report success after a factory reset of the S8. Back up everything on the phone and remove your MicroSD card, and then go to Settings > Backup and reset > Factory data reset.

Folks, the only solution to this has been posted several times now, not just in this thread but several others.

Go to Settings>Apps>Show All Apps>Caller ID>Storage>Clear Data.
If the issue persists, Force Stop the Application from that same screen.

Please be sure to try these before posting to ask what to do to fix it. Thanks.

Alright, I was just wondering if it was from the states or an international model. Thanks for that info. From the looks of it, I would say there's moisture detected in the charging port. The device will prevent wired charging when moisture is detected in the USB port.  Wireless charging will still function when wired charging is disabled. Even if the phone hasn't experienced a splash, the charging cable may have. If she can't get it to turn on though, I would recommend setting up an evaluation of the phone with our support team.

Hey @Darby17
Ooo, I would be demanding my friend fix what they did. However, Voice Assistance (while it can be annoying) also works under specific rules. Normally when you first tap something on the screen it says what it was you hit. Tapping it a second time will actually recognize that you intended to hit it. So when it comes to typing in a password or PIN, touching what you want to select twice in a row is the key. Same goes for selecting menu options, so keep that in mind too.

Naturally you can also try a friend or family member's charger just to see. If it works, awesome! The charger was the problem and can either be tossed and you can buy a new one, or you can contact Samsung directly and ask for a new one (a bit slower a process there though). If the test chargers aren't working right either then you might have to contact Samsung for a repair on the phone itself.
In that case, definitely reach out to Samsung directly via Phone (1-800-SAMSUNG/1-800-726-7864), Twitter, or even Facebook. You can also reach out to your carrier to see if they have a different option you might like more or maybe someone here in the Community has some other ideas!

I have tried 5 different XMPP chat clients. They all give SSL errors. Samsung seems to have no way of reporting bugs. Samsung support refuses to suppoprt non-Samsung apps.Other people are seeing the same problem with their S8s. It is a Samsung issue!!!

Hello allI have been enjoying my galaxy S8 for almost 3 weeks now but there is a very annoying bug that is really driving me crazy. When I am in a call everything is fine but sometimes due to bad connections in some areas the signal is lost and the call ends but whenever this happens, there is a very silly bug that makes the phone completely silent with no sound at all. No matter what sound profile I have, there is no sound at all. No call sound (cannot hear the ring or the voice of who picks up) No music sound and no device sound (while clicking on any button or doing any interaction) the phone goes completely silent till I restart it. I searched alot to see if there is such an issue and saw that people reports sound gets lost when they stream videos for a few seconds but that is not my case.Additionally, I kept trying to figure out any settings that may have caused this but I couldn't find anything except that after the call got ended, I checked the volume control widget (as in the attachment below) I found the ""In-Call Volume"" slider and I was not even in the call anymore!!!! This is the reason for the bug I guess. I then put the phone into the charger and the ""In-Call Volume"" slider disappeared but the issue remained -- no sound at all till I restarted the phone.Any help?...PS: Vibration works so well.

Hello there, @userou5IjnJ3W7
Let's try some troubleshooting steps, just let us know how these go!

Are all your Apps are up to date? You have 2 places that you need to look. Google Play store and Galaxy app store. Go to both and check My Apps. Make sure there is no app that needs updating. 
Is your phone OS up to date? Go to Settings, About phone and check for software update. Make sure you have the latest phone software. 
Clear phone cache. Instructions are here. 
Clear Application cache and sometime Application data. Instructions are here. 
Restart your phone in Safe mode. This is just to help you isolate the issue if it is caused by 3rd part apps. Instructions are here. 

If those don't help, we certainly want to assist you further with this matter. To better do that, can we have some added details about your specific device and this concern? Things that will help the most would be the exact model number and Baseband version (both under Settings>About Device) for your device as well as your carrier. Thanks!

Hey @Adrian1560
Normally you would need to be on an AT&T network to get those update. However, this sounds like the perfect opportunity to use Smart Switch! When downloaded onto your computer you can use the program to update the device as long as that update was pushed out to your device at one point. You can see more about this program here on our site: http://www.samsung.com/us/smart-switch/

Just moved from a 1+2 to the S8+. Before that I had a s1 through s5.So, I am somewhat relearning the Galaxy phones again, so forgive me if I use some wrong terminology.The 1+2 had a slider switch that first would let only priority call through. The next click blocked all except alarms.I think blocking mode is equivalent to first click O with line. And touching the speaker twice, speaker with line is equivalent to second click.
My questions:1. Is there a short cut for blocking mode without having to go through settings…. ?2. Is my understanding correct? So blocking mode would be for napping/sleeping where I would want to be interrupted for something important. And the speaker with line would be for church/movies where I don’t want it to go off at all.
BTW, if my understanding is correct, I like the 2nd call in 15 minutes. I like being able to set my boss and owners to a priority, so their ring makes it through the first time, but I can tell family to call twice if important.

Thanks @SamsungMel, I wasn't very clear on what I was looking for. I wasn't for sure how to phrase it.I did find how to do what I was looking for. To make the ""Do not disturb"" easily accesable Do ...1. Pull down notifactaion bar2. Three dots in upper left hand corner, choose ""Button order""3. Move the ""Do not disturb"" button to the first row. (You will have to demote something) Now when you pull down the notifactaion bar, the ""Do not distrub"" will be on the same line as ""Sound"" button. So no matter if you want to mute all sounds or invoke your ""Do not distrub"" rules, it is just a swipe and button press away.

I believe you can do it on the samsung default email app... Click ""attach""...Select ""other"" down at the bottom...Then choose ""cloud server"". If you have one drive installed properly,  it will show as an option after choosing ""cloud server""...see my screen shot below... Hope that helps...

I have my S8 on sound mode. I do not want it to vibrate ever, under any circumstances. I have ""vibrate while ringing"" off but third party apps still vibrate AND play a sound. This is a colossal waste of power. Does anyone know how to fix this? The problem is only with 3rd party apps. I want them to make sounds but no vibration.

Awesome! So go ahead and open up Hangouts. From there click the 3 bars in the top left corner. Go to Settings. From there go ahead and click on your account (for example mine is my email!). You should see a 'Notifications' section with Messages and Incoming Calls. Both can be clicked on directly and changed so that no vibrations happen or it doesn't even send notifications at all.

I hit up your other post about the darker bar at the bottom, and looked a little more into the app resizing, which boiled down to the actual UQHD resizing. A lot of apps seemed to have this resolution skew, which is pretty much a result of the odd resolution that no other device on the market currently has. It is something that should be reported to those app developers when found, and hopefully might get updated in the future should they find it important enough.

Hello there, @userTUaTxxI3T7
Let's try some troubleshooting steps, just let us know how these go!

Are all your Apps are up to date? You have 2 places that you need to look. Google Play store and Galaxy app store. Go to both and check My Apps. Make sure there is no app that needs updating. 
Is your phone OS up to date? Go to Settings, About phone and check for software update. Make sure you have the latest phone software. 
Clear phone cache. Instructions are here. 
Clear Application cache and sometime Application data. Instructions are here. 
Restart your phone in Safe mode. This is just to help you isolate the issue if it is caused by 3rd part apps. Instructions are here. 

If those don't help, we certainly want to assist you further with this matter. To better do that, can we have some added details about your specific device and this concern? Things that will help the most would be the exact model number and Baseband version (both under Settings>About Device) for your device as well as your carrier and when you started noticing this happen. Thanks!

The samsung gods must have been listening to my prayers! And a few mins after 12 so officially on my birthday, so I guess happy birthday to me from samsung! Good luck to anyone still going through the process, and the best advice I can give is be patient, because I was also starting to be disheartened to the point that I was starting to sadly accept that I wouldn't be receiving anything, but samsung came through and I thank them for that. So just be patient people, and I wouldn't recommend calling customer service because the only answer they'll really have is tell you to just wait it out after being on hold for 2-4 hours, when in reality waiting actually does seem to work.

Certainly! The Note offers a huge variety of the very best of what Samsung has to offer. The beat suggestion I can offer to you is take out your s-pen and place it close enough to the screen where you see a little circle appear. About the size of this    °    and then click the button located on the side closest to the tip of the s-pen. Please be sure your not confusing it with the clicky end that is used for ejecting the pen.  Let me know if this helps you....😎

Hi Everyone, I was able to sign-up for the Premium Care finally.  The best way to do it, since their phone support sucks, is to go to th email that you received, when you either registered your device or the automated welcome email from Samsung that contains your phone's model and serial #, that says ""Thanks for Joining the Galaxy"" in the Headline of the email. Click on the Learn More or use this link: http://www.samsung.com/us/support/premium-care/?redir=samsung%20premium%20care That link takes you directly to Premium Care, then when it asks for what options, after the SMS confirmation, open it in the Samsung +, and it should work now. Good luck!

Hi,I have an unlocked Note 8 that is missing the video call option that has been on the call amd contact screens (Video camera icon) on all my previous  note and galaxy devices.  I see the option to use Duo, but it isn't the same and pretty inconvenient.  Is there a way to enable this feature? My wife has the s8(t-mobile version) and the option is there. I hope this wasn't removed from the note 8 or unlocked version.Thanks

						Hey everyone, I got my unlocked Note 8 yesterday and have been using it with a T-Mobile sim card. I spent a bunch of time trying to get the built in video calling to work and I finally got it, so I thought I would post a guide so the next person doesn't have to do the leg work.Here is what I did, and I can now call other T-Mobile users via dialer based video calls: (the one down side is all numbers show the video call option, even if they are not T-Mobile customers, the calls just turn into audio when the other person answers)1. Download Shortcut Master from app store (Light version works, but it's a great app, support the dev if you can)2. Open the app and go to the menu (three dot's top right) and select app explorer3. Scroll down to IMS Settings and select it.4. Scroll down to ImsSettingsLauncherActivity (last item on my list) select it and hit launch.5. Select IMS Service Switch and under that turn on everything on that screen. (For me most things (especially RCS items) were disabled by default, but when I looked at a friends S8+ settings they were all on so I tried that and all works now.)6.

						Wow, I figured it out. Somehow my lockscreen timeout changed to 10 minutes. So phone was not really locking until after 10 minutes of screen going off. So when I was trying to unlock before that, there was nothing to unlock as the phone was not locked. I changed the setting for the phone to lock instantly on power button or screen timeout and voila, fingerprint unlock started working. So strange for that setting to change, I never touched it.

A Trade-In Device is in ""good condition"" if it:• Powers on and holds a charge;• Has a functioning display;• Has no breaks or cracks or other visible defects that go beyond normal wear and tear; AND• Is not on a black list of any kind.In addition to being in “good condition”, your Qualifying Trade-In Device must satisfy the following additional requirements (as well as all other requirements set forth in these Terms):• Has Reactivation Lock, Google Factory Reset Protection, or any other anti-theft locking software disabled; AND• You must have performed a factory reset and removed all personal information from device (as described in Section 3 above). I've sold many rooted phones to phone buying sites, and they accepted them fine.

Interesting. I've never seen that before. And that's not how my charging screen on my Note 8 looks either.  I did some searching though and found mention to a feature that allows third party applications to display advertisements on your screen when it is charging (see this).  If that's at play here then this advertisement came from an application that was installed.  From the site on which I found this information: You can find out if an app is a culprit in serving ads this way by heading to Settings – Developer Options – Running Services, and tapping each app individually. Inside you may find an app running a service called “ChargeLockerService”. This is the bit that could be serving you ads – you’ll have to switch the app off or uninstall, then reinstall to check.

The Samsung calendar app is telling me that there is an update available but everytime I try to update it I get an error that says the app is no longer available and/or not available in this region. I am using an unlocked note 8 on AT&T  in the US.

Have you already tried to clear the data and cache for the Calendar app?

I've noticed that some features are missing from my note 8 Verizon variant. A few that come to mind are, auto restart and device/task manager. Also, when I long press an app, s short menu doesn't pop up stating to create a folder or uninstall. I don't know if Verizon alter the changes or if my phone maybe a defect. I'm pretty I'll notice more missing features as time goes on.

Hey @Rizzy88
Try the opposite. Turn back on animations and you'll see the pop up. It's turning those off that actually disables the window. Example of others with this same problem.

When I pick Note 8 with any carrier then I have 2 color options, Black and Gray, but when I pick the Unlocked Note 8 then there's only the Black option, but I'd like the Gray Unlocked version. I'm able to order the Gray Unlocked version from other retailers such as Best Buy, but prefer to order from Samsung, is that really not possible and do I have to purchase it from somewhere else?

Hey @userGTQbFIeUHj
At this time the colors are locked in. However, keep in mind that the colors might change availability at a later point like the S8 did.

So i had the Note7, twice. Both times I had the Blue Coral and absolutley loved it.
 
Does anybody know when we will be able to get that color, or even something other than the business standard Black and Gray?

Hey @Aggie1999
I know that right now on the Samsung site it's just Black and Gray, but some places might have some other colors as Unlocked models. Also, after the preorder time period, some other colors might be made available.
